    ## How to Install

        go get -d -u gobot.io/x/gobot/...


    ## How to Use

        :::go
        package main

        import (
        	"time"

        	"gobot.io/x/gobot"
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/drivers/gpio"
        	"gobot.io/x/gobot/platforms/firmata"
        )

        func main() {
        	firmataAdaptor := firmata.NewTCPAdaptor("192.168.1.26:3030")
        	led := gpio.NewLedDriver(firmataAdaptor, "2")

        	work := func() {
        		gobot.Every(1*time.Second, func() {
        			led.Toggle()
        		})
        	}

        	robot := gobot.NewRobot("bot",
        		[]gobot.Connection{firmataAdaptor},
        		[]gobot.Device{led},
        		work,
        	)

        	robot.Start()
        }

    ## How to Connect

    ### Upload the Firmata Firmware to the ESP8266

    This section assumes you're using a ESP8266 or other compatible board. If you already have the Firmata sketch installed on your ESP8266, you can skip straight to the examples.

    #### Install ESP8266 Arduino Addon

    Open up the Arduino IDE, then go to the Preferences (File > Preferences) menu. Add the following URL to the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field:

        http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

    Save the new board manager location by clicking "OK".

    Now go to the Board Manager choosing "Tools > Board > Boards Manager".

    Search for "esp8266", then click on the "Install" button.

    #### Download Wifi Enabled Firmata

    You can obtain the WiFi-enabled version of Firmata from the [http://firmatabuilder.com/](http://firmatabuilder.com/) web site.

    Under "Configure Connection" choose "WiFi" as the "Connection Type".

    Choose "ESP8266" from "Wi-Fi board or shield".

    Enter your network's SSID under "SSID"

    Make sure you choose all of the needed "Core Features", which are normally:

    * DigitalInputFirmata
    * DigitalOutputFirmata
    * AnalogInputFirmata
    * AnalogOutputFirmata
    * I2CFirmata

    Now you can "Build and Download" your custom Firmata.

    #### Flash the ESP8266 With Firmata

    Once the ESP8266 board addon is installed, and you have downloaded your custom Firmata sketch, you are ready to flash your ESP8266.

    Open the custom Firmata you downloaded from FirmataBuilder with the Arduino IDE.

    Customize the sketch with the WPA passphrase for your network settings.

    Make sure your ESP8266 is plugged into your USB port.

    Choose your ESP8266 model from the "Tools > Boards" menu.

    Click on the "Upload" button. Your ESP8266 should now be ready.
