  %p
    Thanks to
    %b Gobot
    and
    %b go
    it is possible to interact with several I/O hardware devices and interfaces connected to the Digispark
    using a set of already defined and easy to use drivers, all of this thanks to the Gobot architecture,
    in conjunction with Gobot Digispark adaptor (using the littlewire communication protocol),
    which makes it even possible to swap the entire platform for something else like Arduino,
    and keep using the same code you just wrote for Digispark, just by swapping a couple
    of lines in your program.
  %p
    Available drivers for the Digispark platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kind
    physical computing (using Gobot and Go) you could be doing:
